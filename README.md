# Bongos 2

Bongos 2 was a main action bar replacement for World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade. It was the successor to Bongos, 
which was my first real addon for World of Warcraft, and was mainly known for being fairly easy to configure and light on resources.
It would be succeeded by [Bongos3](https://github.com/Tuller/Bongos3), and then later [Dominos](https://github.com/tullamods/Dominos).
